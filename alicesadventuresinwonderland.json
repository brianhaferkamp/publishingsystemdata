		"chaptertext": "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the\nbook her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\nit, \"and what is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \"without pictures or\nconversations?\"\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nday made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so\nvery much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh\ndear! I shall be too late!\" But when the Rabbit actually took a watch\nout of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice\nstarted to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take\nout of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after\nit and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under\nthe hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed\nto be a very deep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to\nmake out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;\nthen she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were\nfilled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and\npictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\nshe passed. It was labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE,\" but, to her great\ndisappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so\nmanaged to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n\nDown, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing\nelse to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. \"Dinah'll miss me\nvery much to-night, I should think!\" (Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope\nthey'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish\nyou were down here with me!\" Alice felt that she was dozing off, when\nsuddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry\nleaves, and the fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up,\nbut it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and\nthe White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a\nmoment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to\nhear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late\nit's getting!\" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but\nthe Rabbit was no longer to be seen.\n\nShe found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of\nlamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but\nthey were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side\nand up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There\nwas nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that\nthis might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the\nlocks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it\nwould not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came\nupon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a\nlittle door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key\nin the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage\ninto the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\nthat dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\nthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\ndoorway. \"Oh,\" said Alice, \"how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!\nI think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\"\n\nAlice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\nit, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like\ntelescopes. This time she found a little bottle on it (\"which certainly\nwas not here before,\" said Alice), and tied 'round the neck of the\nbottle was a paper label, with the words \"DRINK ME\" beautifully printed\non it in large letters.\n\n\"No, I'll look first,\" she said, \"and see whether it's marked '_poison_'\nor not,\" for she had never forgotten that, if you drink from a bottle\nmarked \"poison,\" it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\nlater. However, this bottle was _not_ marked \"poison,\" so Alice ventured\nto taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of\ncherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered\ntoast), she very soon finished it off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What a curious feeling!\" said Alice. \"I must be shutting up like a\ntelescope!\"\n\nAnd so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden.\n\nAfter awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.\n\n\"Come, there's no use in crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather\nsharply. \"I advise you to leave off this minute!\" She generally gave\nherself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and\nsometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her\neyes.\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"EAT\nME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, I'll eat it,\" said\nAlice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I'll\nget into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\"\n\nShe ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which\nway?\" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was\ngrowing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize. So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake."
